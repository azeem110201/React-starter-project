# React Project Starter Pack
## Starter pack setup with react-ts, storybook and react-testing along with jest

This starter pack best suites Material UI setup. If you are using any other UI library, then configuration can change based on the requirements. This setup is exclusively for react-typescript. 


## Features

- Theming support to override default MUI styles.
- Support for ESLint
- Testing along with the code coverage


## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Material-UI] - For UI based components
- [Storybook] - Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation
- [Jest] - Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that allows developers to run tests on JavaScript and TypeScript code
- [Webpack-5] - Open sourced module builder which helps in bundling many different assets such as images, fonts and stylesheets.
- [Typescript] - Strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language
